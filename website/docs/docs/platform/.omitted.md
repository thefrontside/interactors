## Questions
### Small
- [ ] Should mentions of `Interactors` and `BigTest` always be capitalized? I've generally been lower casing them when they're an object of a sentence and capitalizing when it's the subject. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<!-- - [ ] Node12 is listed as one of the prerequisites for Interactors. Is that the only version of Node that's compatible? -->
  # - that should not be the case. ask jen why we listed node12 in prerequisites.
<!-- - [ ] Should we include the `Page` interactor in the page that lists all the pre-made ones offered by BigTest? -->
  # yes
- [ ] Should we rename the interactors section in the interactors guide to either `Getting Started` or `Core Concepts`? Having a `Interactors` section in the `Interactors` docs feels unnatural.

### Medium
<!-- - [ ] In our example we use the `Button` interactor. We would like to swap it out for `TextField` but I was debating whether to wait for the `jsdom` issue to be resolved or if it's safe to assume we'll have a solution before the launch. -->
  # yes, we can go ahead and change the example
<!-- - [ ] Are `.exists()`, `.has()`, `.is()`, `.absent()`, and `.find()` technically actions? We introduce actions in the context of writing your own interactors but I'm wondering if we should introduce the five mentioned as the "default actions that are available on all interactors".
  - In the quick start examples we assert against `exists()` and `absent()` but don't really connect the dot between these methods and interactors. If we say they're actions, we could include a short sentence to mention that these are technically actions and are returning a boolean. -->
  # find() is in its own category in that it returns a new interactor scoped within the current interactor, and is generally used for composing actions from interactor primitives:
```js
createInteractor('DatePicker')({
  actions: {
    open: (picker) => picker.find(Button).click()
  }
});
```

### Large
- [ ] [Here](https://deploy-preview-662--bigtest.netlify.app/docs/interactors/interactors/write-your-own#common-questions), we have a `common questions` section and Jen wants to know if there are any other common questions we should include.
  # i will ask robbie and jorge for their feedback
  <!-- - [ ] And regarding the [second question](http://localhost:3000/docs/interactors/interactors/write-your-own#i-have-an-interaction-that-is-really-difficult-to-test-what-should-i-do), what should the user do if the problem is _not_ accessibility? -->
  # > I'd also add that if you are going to write your own interactors, never fear! You can still use the built in interactors in the manner in which I alluded to before, you would just delegate to them. Does that mean we should have a section on using interactors from interactors?

<!-- - [ ] We're thinking of providing a very simple sample app for the interactors doc. Thoughts?
  - It could potentially replace `@bigtest/todomvc`.
  - Using `npx`, users would just need to run `npx @bigtest/sample`.
  - The sample app would come with `Jest`, `Cypress`, and `BigTest alpha` already set up.
    - With custom commands in `package.json`, they could run `yarn jest`, `yarn cypress`. `yarn bigtest:alpha` to see the interactors in action.
  - Jen had a neat idea of how we could decorate the app with BigTest logos. -->
