  - sorry about ubstitute, didn't know that was a word
  - i see you brought up getting-started to the root and it overlaps with the getting-started within interactors
  - line #19, how can we lead the reader to follow along the bigtest/todomvc example under bigtest/platform?
charles
  - is node12 the only compatible version?
  - would it be okay to assume the textfield.fillin issue will be resolved before we release? so that we can swap out the button interactor for the textfield interactor in our examples.
    - better demonstration of value.
everybody
  - i removed asynchronous page to add to the overview instead because the rest of the pages are how-to's.
  - we originally had a `why-bigtest` in `interactors/getting-started` but can we just do `why-bigtest` and `why-interactors` in their respective root/welcome pages?
