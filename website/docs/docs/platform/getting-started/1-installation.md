## Prerequisites
- `npm` or `yarn`
- Node

## Install 
The `bigtest` package includes everything you need to get started sogo ahead and install BigTest to your project:
```
$ yarn add -D bigtest
```

Once that's finished installing, you can run the following command:
```
$ yarn bigtest init
```

This command will help generate the `bigtest.json` file for you. 

The configuration can be modified later so you can just go with its default values for now if you're not sure on some of the settings.
