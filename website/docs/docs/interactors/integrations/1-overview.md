Interactors can be used within many different frameworks!
They are designed to be framework-agnostic so that you can integrate them into your existing test suites.

In this section, you can find examples for using Interactors in some of the most popular testing frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem. 
You will also learn about helper methods that make your tests as readable as possible.

If your testing framework is not in this list, you may still be able to use Interactors. They work best with testing tools that:

- Are focused on testing user interactions, such as clicks and filling in forms
- Rely on the DOM or a simulated DOM (such as [`jsdom`](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom))

If you would like to add some examples for your favorite testing tools to these guides,
