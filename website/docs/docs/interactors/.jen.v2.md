## new notes
  - I think we can squeeze integrations into one page because there's not a much setup required for Jest aside from that it just needs to be `async` and Cypress just needs to cover the two commands.
    - I removed `Introduction` page so that we can squeeze in all the features and details in the landing page of Interactors because having an `Introduction` or `Overview` page right after the landing page would just create an extra barrier to people getting started.
    - And this all goes well with Charles' suggestion that we shouldn't have too many modular pages and just have fewer beefier pages.
  - added new notes in `write-your-own` page.
    - i mention that maybe we should swap out checkbox example for button for continuity/clarity.
    - and we can also choose between textfield and tablecell for the complex example.
  - added find() at the end of `locators-filters-actions`
  - added page interactor in `built-in-dom` and i think it's more for bigtest platform but i will double check
  - and regarding charles' comment on discord:
    > "I hope that this is answering your question, but I'd say that the key thing to recognize is what role bigtest interactors will play in your test rig. Viewed from that light, the most important things to know are that everything about your test setup remains the same except that you will use interactors to manipulate your UI and also to make assertions. What that means in practice is that for example, is you will not use your framework's click() helper, instead using an interactor with a click() action. By the same token, you would replace constructs like jest's expect(thing) with an interactor assertion is()/has()"
  maybe this is something we can discuss in the jest section as it's most relevant there. in the bigtest platform, people will be approaching it as a newcomer so instinctively they'll see the new syntax as a replacement to mocha's it/expect. and in cypress, we have the new commands that does the explaining. so it's only in jest where we don't have a "replacement"

## old notes
<!-- - there was no feedback on whether or not we should always capitalize Interactors. i think we can use either or and let the editor worry about it. -->
  # x

<!-- - i see you listed node12 as a prerequisites but charles says that might only be the case when building the package. so i think we can just list node instead. -->
  # i just changed it to Node minus the 12

<!-- - i was thinking of renaming the interactors dropdown to either `Getting Started` or `Core Concepts` or something else because otherwise we have an interactors section within the interactors docs. What do you think? -->
  # see new notes

<!-- - i asked if there were any other commmonly-asked-questions we should add and while referencing the second question in the commonly-asked-questions, i asked "what should the user do if the problem is not accessibility?" and charles' response was:
  > I'd also add that if you are going to write your own interactors, never fear! You can still use the built in interactors in the manner in which I alluded to before, you would just delegate to them. Does that mean we should have a section on using interactors from interactors?
i'm not sure if he was answering the first question or the second. -->
  <!-- - on monday i will ask robbie and jorge about the first question and we can ask charles on discord to reiterate on the second question for the accessibility. -->
  # i asked jorge and robbie in discord and mentioned it in core meeting
  # and i will follow up with charles and figure out which question he was answering

<!-- - regarding the simple app example, charles is very much on board. these are the points i laid out for the proposed example app:
  + It could potentially replace `@bigtest/todomvc`.
  + Using `npx`, users would just need to run `npx @bigtest/sample`.
  + The sample app would come with `Jest`, `Cypress`, and `BigTest alpha` already set up.
    + With custom commands in `package.json`, they could run `yarn jest`, `yarn cypress`. `yarn bigtest:alpha` to see the interactors in action.
  + Jen had a neat idea of how we could decorate the app with BigTest logos.
  - i forgot to ask in the way that you had written about how polished we would want it to be but i think we can make this as minimalistic as possible and have the team contribute to the app (whether it's design or functionality) -->
  # on discord they were pooping on create-react-app so i'll ask for suggestions on how we could package this in the most lightweight way possible

<!-- - charles left feedback on the pages that you've written out so far: [link](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest/issues/683#issuecomment-733785477)
  - i went ahead and made the changes for his feedback under the stylistic section about how we should type out the full flag name
  - i changed the locator in the write-your-own checkbox example to id from classname for the time being; his last sentence i think is suggesting we make it a bit more complex but since we're adding the tablecell interactor as the more complex example i'm not sure if it's necessary.
    - charles also said we can go ahead and use the textfield interactor as an example so we could probably replace the checkbox example completely. -->
  # x

<!-- - lastly, we touched on it in our last pairing and i asked charles about `find()` because i wasn't sure where we should talk about it and here's what he said:
  > "find() is in its own category in that it returns a new interactor scoped within the current interactor, and is generally used for composing actions from interactor primitives:
    ```js
    createInteractor('DatePicker')({
      actions: {
        open: (picker) => picker.find(Button).click()
      }
    });
    ``` -->
  # added to locators-filters-actions
