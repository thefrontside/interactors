## todos
  - write page interactor in page 2
  - complex example in page 4
  - cypress in page 5
  - review platform pages

## 1-quick-start
  - added suggestion for introducing and linking bigtest platform
  - added reminder on changing todomvc link to bigtest sample

## 3-locators-filters-actions
  - suggestion for locator section
    - changed "most common" to "simplest"
  - rearranged filters
    - omitting locator didn't seem to justify a whole new section so i combined it
    - added the part where multiple filters can be specified
    - removed the list of all the button filters because it might cause confusion of whether it's something that's offered on all default interactors.
  - find()
    - added part about how it can be used in tests too (with an awful example)

## 4-write-your-own
  - changed example to button and updated instructions
  - should we add jest and cypress to the examples here?
