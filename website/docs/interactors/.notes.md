  review platform pages

## 1-quick-start
  - added suggestion for introducing and linking bigtest platform
  - added reminder on changing todomvc link to bigtest sample
  - moved the bigtest platform intro from the bottom of the page to after the tabbed section where people see it for the first time. i think we'll get more views there. i tend to skip the last few paragraphs when it looks like it's wrapping up.

## 2-built-in-dom
  - added section on page interactor

## 3-locators-filters-actions
  - suggestion for locator section
    - changed "most common" to "simplest"
  - rearranged filters
    - added the part where multiple filters can be specified
    - removed the list of all the button filters because it might cause confusion of whether it's something that's offered on all default interactors.
    - added has() and is() as a subsection in filters
  - added find() section on how you can use them in tests too
    - used the datepicker example from how you use find() in createinteractor()

## 4-write-your-own
  - changed example to button and updated instructions
  - removed note on expanding the simple example because it's no longer a checkbox and we still have the complex example
  - got the ball rolling for the complex example `4-write-your-own`
    - example and explanation could be better
    - i'm not sure how much we should dive into the small details

## 5-integration
  - replaced sof/forum links with cypress docs
