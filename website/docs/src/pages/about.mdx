# BigTest

The goal of the BigTest Project is to miniaturize the testing feedback
loop while at the same time expanding the sizes of the systems it is
possible to test.

# Fast

The length of the testing feedback loop is equivalent to the time it
takes from when you start a test until it either succeeds, or it fails
and you are accurately able to understand why it failed. Why do we
care about this metric? The math is simple. A project that can
validate 100 changes in a 24 hour period has the potential of 10 times
the throughput as a project that can only validate 10. This means that
in order to achieve this, tests must be able to run quickly. But while
test speed is a critical ingredient to a tight feedback loop, it is
not the only thing. In the event of failure, the speed of diagnosis
must be commensurately fast. Imagine a test that takes 5 milliseconds
to run, but fails with an error message so inscrutable that it takes a
further 90 minutes to figure out why. Unfortunately, despite a
lightning fast test run, the effective length of the feedback loop is
90 minutes. Thus in order to make testing feedback loops as small as
possible, BigTest components must both run quickly, and provide
failures that are precise and helpful. Apart from this, the only other
substantial factor in the value of a test is its size.

# Big

It is very easy to write tests that are both fast and precise, but at
the same time test almost nothing. These small tests, though
instantaneous, are of little value because the outcomes they measure
are themselves of little value. That’s not to say a React component
rendering its props correctly isn’t critical, it’s just that if you
test only that, and not that the component can be used in a workflow
that correctly transfers money from one user account to another, then
you’re leaving the lion’s share of the value, and thus the fate of
your business, unguarded. At Google, they’ve [arrived at the insight][5]
that "unit test", "functional test", and "end-to-end test" are
arbitrary designations and that what really matters is the relative
size of a test. The larger a test, the more systems it integrates and
thus the more business value it protects. However, as demonstrated in
the blog post from the Google testing team, test size is in direct
conflict with feedback loops size.

The BigTest project approaches every piece of its platform from the
perspective of empowering development teams to master this paradox and
optimize testing feedback loops within the context of truly big, truly
valuable tests.

## Interactors (Beta)

The first piece in our platform, [BigTest Interactors](interactors) is
a library that applies these principles to help you write UI tests
from the outside in.

Interactors manipulate an HTML interface at the highest level
possible: from the perspective of a user, and make no assumptions
about the internal workings of an app. This means that they cover 100%
of your UI code starting from the raw input event handlers down. Not
only that, but this same property means that your tests will work the
same no matter if your application is written in React, Angular, Vue,
or whether you chose to eventually rewrite it in Framework 2043 ™

Not only are Interactors big, but they're both fast and precise
too. By using its unique [convergence strategy][1] and only coupling
wait times to observable states, interactors naturally use the minimum
amount of synchronization time while performing actions and
assertions. Finally, because interactors are strongly associated with
both the type and properties of the UI elements they actuate
(e.g. Button, Checkbox, Input, ...), they can provide the next level
in error messaging when something goes wrong, or an assertion fails.

## Platform (Alpha)

The [BigTest platform](platform) is a tool designed to meet the needs of an entire organization's testing strategy.

Currently, it can be used to test real web applications, against real
browsers on any number of devices... including iOS and Android.
However, it is built to be used not just for testing web applications,
but to support testing on native apps, desktop apps, and even server
side apps.

In order to accomplish this, BigTest has been built from
the ground up to be completely platform indedpendent. Rather that
coupling to a single runtime like [Electron][2] or [WebDriver][3], it
uses an Agent architecture that allows tests to be run on _any_
platform that supports WebSockets (which is pretty much anything!).

Not only that, but the BigTest platform enables radical transparency
into the testing process by making all internal state available over a
convenient GraphQL API. Anything that you can do with BigTest can be
done over GraphQL. In fact, the CLI is nothing more than just another
GraphQL client.

## Simulation (Researching)

A key area of research in the BigTest project involves enabling tests
for systems whose dependencies may or may not be available. This could
be a frontend team that wants to develop against a
backend that doesn't exist yet or is under heavy development, or
perhaps a native developer that wants to make an app for a Bluetooth
device that been designed, but not manufactured. Whatever the reason,
both testing and [the entire developer experience are always better off
with a simulation strategy][4] in place.

We have deployed such simulators on a number of different projects and
are looking into the best ways to package them as independent
producs. Our plans are to release simulators for

* HTTP; both custom backends and well-known 3rd party services like auth0
* Bluetooth Low Energy Peripherals
* Location Services

When using these simulators in the context of testing, the most
important capability that they must posess is the ability to set them
into a known state before each and every test case, and so the
standalone simulators will provide hooks to manufacture and load large
datasets, but also clear them out. However, when using them together
with the BigTest platform, this integration will be seamless.
